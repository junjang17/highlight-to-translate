# Highlight-To-Translate
Highlight-To-Translate is a Chrome extension that allows users to translate text on web pages by highlighting the text. 
This tool is especially useful for language learners who need quick, convenient translations of a few words or phrases
rather than the whole text.


## Usage
Select the desired target language (default is English). Once selected, hit apply and highlight the desired text.



Once the translation is available, click anywhere else to remove the popup.
